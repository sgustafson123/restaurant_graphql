This is a practice exercise for writing queries in GraphQL.

##goal
The goal is to move between the different query types to display various sets of data.

##use
Download the files, then open the command line. Run npm install, then node index.js.  Open a browser window to localhost:5500/graphql.

##Future plans
Not all of the queries are working correctly, so I hope to fix those.
